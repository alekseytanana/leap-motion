This is the feature extractor script for Leap Motion written in Processing 3.5.2
It extends example by Rebecca Fiebrink (https://github.com/fiebrink1/wekinator_examples/blob/master/inputs/LeapMotion/LeapMotionViaProcessing/LeapMotion_Fingertips_15Inputs/LeapMotion_Fingertips_15Inputs.pde) and by default it is dedicated to be used with Wekinator (www.wekinator.org)
In addition to fingers position in 3D space it also extracts and sends to output hand positions: grab, pinch, sphere radius, roll, pitch, yaw.

This requires you to have the Leap SDK installed on your computer, and the de.voidplus.leapmotion library installed in Processing.
